# ðŸš€ Pre-Deployment Checklist

## âœ… CRITICAL: Delete These Files/Folders FIRST

**Before deploying to Vercel again, you MUST delete these leftover Next.js files:**

### Delete These Folders:
```bash
# Navigate to your project folder and delete these:
rm -rf app/
rm -rf api/
rm -rf guidelines/
rm -rf scripts/
```

### Delete These Files:
```bash
# Delete these individual files:
rm .env.local.example
rm deployment-guide.md
rm next.config.js
rm next_config.js
rm cleanup-files.md
```

**Windows Users:** Select these folders/files in File Explorer and press Delete key.

**Mac Users:** Select these folders/files in Finder and press Cmd+Delete.

## âœ… After Cleanup - Your Project Should Look Like:

```
my-portfolio/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”œâ”€â”€ lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tsx
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ vite.config.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ postcss.config.js
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Attributions.md
â””â”€â”€ PRE-DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md (this file)
```

## âœ… Final Deployment Steps:

### Option 1: If Using GitHub (Recommended)
1. **Delete the unwanted files** (listed above)
2. **Open GitHub Desktop**
3. **Review changes** - you should see deletions of Next.js files
4. **Commit with message**: "Clean up Next.js files for Vite deployment"
5. **Push to GitHub**
6. **Vercel will auto-deploy** with the correct 'dist' output

### Option 2: If Using Drag & Drop
1. **Delete the unwanted files** (listed above)
2. **Run build command**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. **Look for 'dist' folder** (not 'build' folder)
4. **Drag 'dist' folder to Vercel**

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Result:

- âœ… Vercel will find the 'dist' directory
- âœ… Build warnings will be gone
- âœ… Your portfolio will deploy successfully
- âœ… You'll get a live URL like: `https://your-portfolio.vercel.app`

## ðŸ†˜ If Build Still Fails:

1. **Check the build output** in Vercel dashboard
2. **Look for the 'dist' folder** in build logs
3. **Verify all Next.js files are deleted**
4. **Try building locally first**: `npm run build`

---

**ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip**: The main issue was that Vite was building to 'build' directory but Vercel expected 'dist'. This is now fixed in your `vite.config.ts`!
